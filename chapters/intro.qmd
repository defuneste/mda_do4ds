# Introduction {.unnumbered}

**Learning objectives:**

- introducing some definitions and a bit of history 

## Definitions

 *production* :  

>   affecting decision in your orgs / world 

> putting your work in front of someone elseâ€™s eyes

We want:

- our works to be **reliable**

- in a safe **environement** 

- our work to be **available** 

## DevOps

> DevOps is a set of **cultural norms**, **practices**, and **tooling** to help make developing and deploying software **smoother** and **lower risk**.

.. but is a squishy concept and a "vendor" associated name 

It came in opposition to the *waterfall dev process* were you had a team doing Dev. and then one other doing Ops (Ops "make it works on veryone computer"). 

## Process and people

- Are data scientist software developper?

- Are we in the red flags number 3?

- Do we need a workbench (ie using ec2) ?

- should we do the exercice with `penguins` or one of our dataset?
